## My personal goals

With this challenge, I wanted to make fully responsive website with well organized code based on components.

## Tools I used

To finish this challenge I used  HTML and SASS with BEM to make as clean code as I could. To get easily responsive design, I used Flexbox. For the first time, I was using Figma to get my design as close as possible to a graphic's project.

## Problems I had

I had a little problem with making header well responsive as for mobile as for desktop, but it ended pretty well.
