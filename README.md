## My personal goals

After learning a lot about coding layouts, I finally wanted to start doing it fully on my own. This is a first try.

## Tools I used

To finish this challenge I used  HTML and SASS with BEM to make as clean code as I could. To get easily responsive design, I used Flexbox.

## Problems I had

There was no bigger problems with this challenge, except of being not sure of my own code - but I believe it will come with time.
